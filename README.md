# EF5-US-Parameters

This dataset consists of the Ensemble Framework For Flash Flood Forecasting (EF5; https://github.com/HyDROSLab/EF5) model parameters developed for the first version of the implementation running within the Flooded Locations And Simulated Hydrographs (FLASH) system, which was transitioned to flash flood warning operations in the United States' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Weather Service (NWS) in November of 2016.

Analysis of simulations based on these parameters were also featured in EF5's publication:

Flamig, Z.L., Vergara, H. and Gourley, J.J., 2020. The Ensemble Framework For Flash Flood Forecasting (EF5) v1. 2: Description and Case Study. Geoscientific Model Development Discussions, pp.1-26.

Parameters included correspond to the following models:

- CREST
- SAC-SMA
- Hydrophobic (HP)
- Kinematic Wave
- Linear Reservoirs
